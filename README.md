# ML_identify-customer-behavior

This repository contains final submissions for the BMLP (Belajar Machine Learning Pemula) program. The project includes both **clustering** and **classification** tasks using several machine learning algorithms.

# **DATASET INFORMATION**
## Background

In the retail business world, understanding customer behavior is a crucial factor in determining marketing strategies, improving services, and making data-based decisions. One common approach used to understand customer behavior is through segmentation, which is the process of grouping customers into several segments or groups based on certain characteristics.

By applying the **unsupervised learning** method, especially **clustering**, this project aims to form customer segmentation that represents similar purchasing patterns. The results of this segmentation are expected to provide valuable insights for management, especially in developing more targeted promotional strategies, developing loyalty programs, and optimizing customer service.
